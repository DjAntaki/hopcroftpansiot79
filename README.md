This is an implementation of Hopcroft and Pansiot algorithm to solve the reachability problem in 2 dimensions Vector Addition System with States (2-VASS).

Implementation details
-> Elementary cycle are calculated with tarjan's algorithm. I used the implementation found here :
-> Logical constraints formula are solved using Z3 Theorem Prover. ()

Dependencies
------------
 - Developped for python 2.7
 - Z3 : https://github.com/Z3prover/Z3
